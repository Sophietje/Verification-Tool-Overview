#### Related tools (tools mentioned or compared to in the paper):
Probably related to [QuIP](Checkers/QuIP.md) by the same authors. The authors claim that QuIPFly outperforms QuIP "by at least an order of magnitude in runtime".
Also compared to [DetLP](DetLP.md) in the CAV 2019 paper. The authors claim that QuIPFly outperforms [DetLP](DetLP.md) both in runtime and number of benchmarks solved.
