Systematic testing tool for message-passing concurrent programs

#### Name:
SYCO

#### Application domain/field:
Partial-order reduction (POR)
Concurrent programs
Actor programs
Message-passing programs

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
Testing tool

#### Expected input thing:
ABS program

#### Expected input format:
`.abs` file

#### Expected output:
?

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
*Actor programs*: Programs consisting of computing entities called actors. Each actor has its own local state and thread of control. The actors communicate by exchanging messages asynchronously.

*Partial Order Reduction (POR)*: Algorithms that are based on the idea that some program interleavings can be considered equivalent, and that you only need to explore one interleaving per equivalence class.
