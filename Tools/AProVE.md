AProVE is a system for automatic termination and complexity analysis of C, Java, Haskell, Prolog, and several forms of rewrite systems

#### Name:
AProVE

#### Application domain/field:
Termination
Non-termination

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
Termination & complexity analyzer

#### Expected input thing:
Program

#### Expected input format:
C, Java, Haskell, Prolog or a rewrite system.

Also described in more detail on: https://aprove.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/download

#### Expected output:
`YES`, `NO`, `MAYBE`, `TIMEOUT` indicating whether it could prove termination for the given system.
