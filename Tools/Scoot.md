Tool for the analysis of SystemC systems. It extracts models that can be passed to tools such as [[SatAbs]] and [CBMC](Checkers/CBMC.md).

#### Name:
SCOOT

#### Application domain/field:
Model checking
Simulation
Model extraction
SystemC
Concurrency

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
Model extractor?

#### Expected input thing:
SystemC program

#### Expected input format:
C++ files that use the SystemC header (`#include <systemc.h>`)

#### Expected output:
Formal model or a flat C++ program that does not use the SystemC library anymore.

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
SCOOT statically analyses systems described using SystemC and extracts models that can be passed to verification tools such as [[SatAbs]] or [CBMC](Checkers/CBMC.md). It focuses on the scheduling of the SystemC threads. SCOOT can do race analysis.
