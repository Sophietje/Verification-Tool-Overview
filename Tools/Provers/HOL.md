#### Name:
HOL

#### Application domain/field:
Interactive theorem proving
Theorem proving
Proof assistant

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
Proof assistant

#### Expected input thing:
Script file

#### Expected input format:
`.sml` and `.sig` files 

#### Expected output:
?

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
Depending on the complexity of what needs to be proven, the user might need to provide guidance to the proof assistant. It can also prove some things on its own without guidance.

It is worth checking out libraries to see whether your problem (or something similar) has already been proven.
