Why3 environment for deductive program verification is built around a kernel that implements a formal specification language, based on typed first-order logic

#### Name:
Why3

#### Application domain/field:
Deductive verification
Verification conditions

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
Deductive verifier/verification infrastructure

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
- Given a [[WhyML]] program, Why3 will generate verification conditions which can be discharged using automated or interactive theorem provers.
- Users can also write [[WhyML]] programs directly and get a correct-by-construction OCaml program.
- [[WhyML]] is a language specifically for Why3. It is used as an intermediate language for the verification of C, Java, or Ada programs.
