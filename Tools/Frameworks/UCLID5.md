#### Name:
UCLID5

#### Application domain/field:
Modeling
Verification
Synthesis
Framework

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
Framework for modelling, verification and synthesis of systems

#### Expected input thing:
Model

#### Expected input format:
UCLID5 language

#### Expected output:
Depends on the analysis that is used

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
Specifications can be written in several formats, including inline assertions in sequential code, pre-/postconditions for procedures, global axioms and invariants.

UCLID5 supports several verification techniques including bounded model checking, induction and k-induction, and more.

UCLID5 can also be used to synthesize function bodies for user-declared functions such that the verification task will succeed.
