ROLL 1.0 is an ùúî-regular language learning library with command line tools to learn and complement B√ºchi automata

#### Name:
ROLL: Regular Omega Language Learning

#### Application domain/field:
B√ºchi automata
Automata learning
Active automata learning
ùúî-regular languages

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
Library for automata learning

#### Expected input thing:
- Command indicating the running mode (e.g. `learn`, `convert`, `complement`, `include`)
- *Optional*: Depending on the command used, the user might need to give zero, one or two B√ºchi automata.

#### Expected input format:
- *Command*: Argument that is passed when calling ROLL
- *B√ºchi automata*: Hanoi Omega Automata ([HOA](../../Formats/HOA.md)) format and the BA format used by [RABIT](RABIT.md)

#### Expected output:
Depends on how the library is used. Typically it will output a learned or complement automaton along with some execution information.

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
This is a library for learning ùúî-regular languages, which can be used to describe liveness properties.

Uses [RABIT](RABIT.md) to check the equivalence of two B√ºchi automata.

The library can be used for:
- Learning an input B√ºchi automaton
- Converting files in the BA format to the HOA format or the other way around.
- Computing the complement of a B√ºchi automaton
- Check the language inclusion between two B√ºchi automata
