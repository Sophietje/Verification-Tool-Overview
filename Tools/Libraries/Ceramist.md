#### Name:
Ceramist: Certified Approximate Membership Structures

#### Application domain/field:
Probabilistic data structures
Approximate Membership Query structures (AMQs)

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
Library

#### Expected input thing:
-

#### Expected input format:
-

#### Expected output:
-

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
Uses [Coq](../Provers/Coq.md), [[MathComp]], [[Infotheo]]

#### Comments:
Coq-based mechanised framework, specialised for reasoning about Approximate Membership Query structures (AMQs), implemented as a [Coq](../Provers/Coq.md) library
AMQs -> probabilistic data structures that compactly implement (multi-)sets via hashing
