This folder contains tool pages for tools that are considered metatools. Metatools are tools that are supposed to be used in combination with other tools. 
Some examples of metatools are tools that select which algorithm to be used in another tool, or for example The Axiom Profiler which is a tool used to detect matching loops in SMT solvers such as Z3.
