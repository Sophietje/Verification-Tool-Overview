Optimization Modulo Theories (OMT) tool

OptiMathSat allows for solving a list of optimization problems on SMT formulas with linear objective functions. It supports Boolean, rational and integer domains, as well as combinations of these, including MaxSMT.

#### Name:
OptiMathSAT

#### Application domain/field:
Optimization Modulo Theories (OMT)
Optimization problems
SMT formulas
Linear objective functions

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
Optimization solver?

#### Expected input thing:
?

#### Expected input format:
One of the following two:
- [SMT-LIB](../../Formats/SMT-LIB.md) v2, enriched with language extensions for dealing with optimization capabilities
- [[FlatZinc]] 1.6 language format

#### Expected output:
?

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
Extension of [MathSAT](SMT/MathSAT.md) 5. 
OMT is an extension of SMT to find models that optimize objection functions
