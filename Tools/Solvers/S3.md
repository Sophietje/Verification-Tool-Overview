String model counter

#### Name:
S3 (versions: S3P, S3#, S3N)

#### Application domain/field:
Model counting
String constraints
String solver

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
String solver/model counter

#### Expected input thing:
- Input formula
- *Optional*: Query length

#### Expected input format:
- *Input formula*: Own language
- *Optional query length*: passed as a parameter?

#### Expected output:
Upper bound for the model count?

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
The **model counting problem** is about counting the number of satisfiable assignments for a constraint formula.

This was built on top of S3P, an earlier version of the same tool, which has been built on top of [Z3](Solvers/SMT/Z3.md).

#### Comments:
There is a newer version of this tool available under the name S3N (last release on 26 November 2020).
