Java library for boolean satisfaction and optimization problems.
It can solve SAT, MAXSAT, Pseudo-Boolean and Minimally Unsatisfiable Subset (MUS) problems.

#### Name:
Sat4j

#### Application domain/field:
SAT-based solvers
MaxSAT problems
Optimization problems

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
Java library that provides access to SAT-related technologies.

#### Expected input thing:
?

#### Expected input format:
[DIMACS](../../Formats/DIMACS.md), or Aralia formula?

#### Expected output:
`UNSATISFIABLE` if it is unsatisfiable
`SATISFIABLE` if satisfiable, or it may cause an exception if e.g. a timeout occurs.
