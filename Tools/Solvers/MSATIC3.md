#### Name:
MSATIC3

#### Application domain/field:

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):

#### Expected input thing:

#### Expected input format:

#### Expected output:

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
It is used as a back-end solver of [nuXmv](../Checkers/nuXmv.md) alongside [MathSAT](SMT/MathSAT.md).
The IC3 most likely refers to an incremental model checking algorithm for invariance properties.
