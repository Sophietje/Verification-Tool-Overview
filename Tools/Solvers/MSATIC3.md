#### Name:
MSATIC3

#### Application domain/field:

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):

#### Expected input thing:

#### Expected input format:

#### Expected output:

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
It is used as a back-end of [nuXmv](nuXmv.md) alongside [MathSAT](MathSAT.md).
The IC3 most likely refers to an incremental model checking algorithm  for invariance properties.

#### Comments:
TODO: Maybe need to remove this one? Seems like a back-end of NuSMV that is not available on its own
