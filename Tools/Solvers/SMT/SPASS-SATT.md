a complete solver for ground linear arithmetic

#### Name:
SPASS-SATT

#### Application domain/field:
SMT solving

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
SMT solver

#### Expected input thing:

#### Expected input format:
a subset of the [[SMT-LIB]] standard v2.6 

#### Expected output:

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
Supported theories are QF\_LRA (ground linear rational arithmetic), QF\_LIA (ground linear integer arithmetic), and QF\_LIRA (ground linear mixed arithmetic). The theory solver used by SPASS-SATT is called [SPASS-IQ](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/automation-of-logic/software/spass-workbench/spass-iq/).
