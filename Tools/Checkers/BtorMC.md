#### Name:
BtorMC

#### Application domain/field:
Model checking
Bounded model checking

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
Model checker

#### Expected input thing:
?

#### Expected input format:
[Btor2](../../Formats/Btor2.md) model

#### Expected output:
?

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
BtorMC is a bounded model checker.
It can check safety properties for models with registers and memories.
It also produces witnesses for satisfiable properties.

Uses [Boolector](../Solvers/SMT/Boolector.md) 3.0

#### Comments:
It is called a 'reference' bounded model checker in the paper.

#### URIs (github, websites, etc.):
