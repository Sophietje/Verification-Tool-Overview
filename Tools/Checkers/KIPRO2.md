KIPRO2: k-Induction for probabilistic programs
(note: 2 is part of the name, not a version number)

It performs in parallel latticed k-induction and BMC (bounded model checking) to fully automatically verify upper bounds on expected values of `{pGCL}` programs. It can also reason about expected values, e.g. expected runtimes, of such programs.

Uses [Z3](Z3.md), [[PySMT]]
