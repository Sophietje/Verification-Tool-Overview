Model checking
Markov decision processes (MDPs)
Reachability properties

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
Model checker

#### Expected input thing:
One of the following types of models:
- STA (stochastic timed automaton)
- PTA (probabilistic timed automaton)
- MDP (Markov decision process)
- DTMC (discrete-time Markov chain)

And properties that should be checked (LTL or CTL)

#### Expected input format:
[Modest](../Frameworks/Modest.md) Toolset format or [JANI](../../Formats/JANI.md) format.

#### Expected output:
?

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
This is part of the [Modest](../Frameworks/Modest.md) Toolset. It is described on the project page as a "disk-based explicit-state model checker for STA (stochastic timed automata), PTA (probabilistic timed automata) and MDP (Markov decision processes)."
