BCV-based solver for DS-inclusion.

#### Name:
QuIP

#### Application domain/field:
Quantitative inclusion
Automata
Discounted-sum inclusion
Weighted automata

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
Property checker (DS-inclusion)

#### Expected input thing:
- Weighted automata P, Q
- Discounted-factor $d$

#### Expected input format:
?

#### Expected output:
Whether $P \subseteq_d Q$

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
BCV is an algorithm for solving DS-inclusion. The name BCV is derived from the name of the authors.
DS-inclusion is about determining the quantitative inclusion for nondeterministic discounted-sum (DS) automata.

Uses [RABIT](../RABIT.md) to check language inclusion and [Reduce](../Reduce.md) for minimizing BÃ¼chi automata.
