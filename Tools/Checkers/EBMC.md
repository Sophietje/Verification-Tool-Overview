EBMC is a Model Checker for hardware designs. It includes both bounded and unbounded analysis, i.e., it can both discover bugs and is also able to prove the absence of bugs.

#### Name:
EBMC

#### Application domain/field:
Model checking
Hardware design

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
Model checker

#### Expected input thing:
- Synthesizable hardware design at register transfer level (RTL)
- Safety or liveness property

#### Expected input format:
- *Hardware design*: [[../../Formats/Verilog]], Netlists (ISCA89 format), System Verilog or SMV file
	- https://www.cprover.org/ebmc/manual/verilog_language_features/ describes the synthesizable subset of Verilog
- *Property*: SystemVerilog assertions or LTL

#### Expected output:
Per failure it will report whether it could prove it (`SUCCESS`) or not (`FAILURE`).
When EBMC refutres a property, it will compute a counterexample (path from initial state to an error state).

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
EBMC supports bounded and unbounded analysis. It uses k-induction, bounded model checking (BMC) and a BDD engine.
The BDD engine and k-induction are used for unbounded safety verification. BMC is used to check liveness properties.
