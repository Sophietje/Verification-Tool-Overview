#### Name:
ForeSee: Formula Exploitation by Sequence Tree for falsification

#### Application domain/field:
Falsification
Cyber-physical systems
Hybrid systems
Temporal logic
Optimization-based falsification
Signal temporal logic (STL)

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
?

#### Expected input thing:
- Simulink model
- STL specification

#### Expected input format:
Simulink model

#### Expected output:
Input that triggers the violation of the specification?

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
**Falsification**: Given a desired temporal specification, try to find an input of violation instead of a proof guarantee.
