#### Name:
PRODIGY: PRObability DIstributions via GeneratingfunctionologY

#### Application domain/field:
Probabilistic programs

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
?

#### Expected input thing:
Probabilistic (non-negative) integer program

#### Expected input format:
`ReDiP` probabilistic programming language

#### Expected output:
PRODIGY will decide whether a given probabilistic loop is equivalent to an (invariant) specification encoded as a loop-free ReDiP program.

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
The tool Probably (https://github.com/Philipp15b/Probably) forms the basis of their implementation.
