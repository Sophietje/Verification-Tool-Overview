#### Name:
SPIN

#### Application domain/field:
Multi-threaded software
Model checking
Simulation
Concurrency

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
Model checker + simulator

#### Expected input thing:
- System description
- Properties: can be expressed as system or process invariants (using assertions), as linear temporal logic (LTL) requirements, as BÃ¼chi automata, or as omega-regular properties.

#### Expected input format:
[PROMELA](../Formats/PROMELA.md)

#### Expected output:
It reports on deadlocks, race conditions, different types of incompleteness, unwarranted assumptions about the relative speed of processes, and property violations.

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
Spin is a open-source software verification tool for formal verification of multi-threaded software applications. It can be used in four main modes:

- as a **simulator**, allowing for rapid prototyping with a random, guided, or interactive simulations
- as an **exhaustive verifier**, capable of rigorously proving the validity of user specified correctness requirements (using partial order reduction theory to optimize the search)
- as **proof approximation system** that can validate even very large system models with maximal coverage of the state space.
- as a driver for **swarm verification** (a new form of swarm computing that can exploit cloud networks of arbitrary size), which can make optimal use of large numbers of available compute cores to leverage parallelism and search diversification techniques, which increases the chance of locating defects in very large verification models.
