#### Application domain/field:
Program synthesis
Recursive programs

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
Synthesis tool

#### Expected input thing:
- Set of input-output examples
- Set of components allowed to appear in the synthesized program

#### Expected input format:
?

#### Expected output:
Recursive program that implements the intended behaviour

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
Given input-output examples, it synthesizes recursive programs implementing the intended behaviour.
