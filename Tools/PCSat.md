Satisfiability checking tool for pfwCSP based on stratified Counterexample-guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS).

Uses [Z3](Z3.md)

pfwCSP: new class of predicate Constraint Satisfaction Problems. This allows constraints that are arbitrary (i.e. possibly non-Horn) clauses modulo first-order theories over predicate variables that can be functional predicates, well-founded predicates or ordinary predicates. This is a generalization over Constrained Horn Clauses.
