#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
Optimization solver

#### Expected input thing:
- Model (LP or MIP problem)
- *Optionally*: data (allows the user to solve the same model with different data)

#### Expected input format:
- *Model*: GMPL modeling language (.mod file)
- *Data*: GMPL modeling language (.dat file)

#### Expected output:
.sol file describing the solution as standard text

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
This is a stand-alone solver for LP (linear programming) and MIP (mixed integer programming) that is part of [[GLPK]].
