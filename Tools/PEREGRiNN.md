An algorithm for efficiently and formally verifying the input/output behavior or ReLU neural networks.

Sound and complete 'search and optimization' neural network verifier


Compared to: [[Neurify]], [[Venus]], [[nnenum]], [[Marabou]]

Uses [Gurobi](Gurobi.md) 9.1 convex optimizer for solving linear programs, [[Volesti]] to sample from the input polytope for the sampling inference block
