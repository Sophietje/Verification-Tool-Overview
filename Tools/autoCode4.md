autoCode4 synthesizes structured reactive controllers from realizable specifications in the GXW subset of linear temporal logic (LTL)

#### Name:
autoCode4

#### Application domain/field:
Reactive controllers
Program synthesis
Controller synthesis

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):

#### Expected input thing:
- Specification in the GXW subset of LTL.

#### Expected input format:
?

#### Expected output:
Reactive controller as a Ptolemy II model. From this model one can automatically generate executable C or HDL code.
autoCode4 can also generate reactive controllers in Lustre.

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
autoCode4 maintains traceability between individual requirements and the generated controller blocks.
