#### Name:
JitSynth

#### Application domain/field:
Domain specific languages (DSLs)
Program synthesis
Just-in-time (JIT) compilation

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
Synthesis tool

#### Expected input thing:
Syntax, semantics and a mapping from source to target states

#### Expected input format:
As a program in a solver-aided host language, e.g. Rosette.

#### Expected output:
A verified JIT compiler that can transform a program in the source DSL into a semantically equivalent program in the target language.

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
Tool for synthesizing verified JIT (just-in-time) compilers for in-kernel DSLs (domain specific languages). 

Uses [[Rosette]]
