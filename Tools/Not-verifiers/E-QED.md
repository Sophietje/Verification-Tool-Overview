*Seems to be an approach/technique, not a specific tool*

Technique to automatically localize electrical bugs during post-silicon validation

Post-silicon validation: process in the manufacturing of integrated circuits where these circuits are extensively tested in actual system environments to detect design bugs

Uses Questa Formal tool for bounded model checking.
