SMT-based model checker

Designed with three use cases in mind:
1) Push-button verification
2) Expert verification
3) Model checker development


Uses [MathSAT](MathSAT.md)] 5 as an underlying SMT solver and interpolant producer. Also uses [Boolector](Boolector.md) for hardware model checking problems.
