#### Name:
ATLAS: Automated Learning of Abstractions

#### Application domain/field:
Program synthesis

#### Type of tool (e.g. model checker, test generator):
?

#### URIs (github, websites, etc.):

#### Expected input:

- Abstraction-Guided Synthesizer (AGS)
- Training set of synthesis problems (i.e. input-output problems)

#### Expected output:
Abstract domain in the form of predicate templates and abstract transformers for each DSL construct.

#### Internals (tools used, frameworks, techniques, paradigms, ...):
"a novel technique for automatically learning domain-specific abstractions that are useful for instantiating an example-guided synthesis framework in a new domain"
