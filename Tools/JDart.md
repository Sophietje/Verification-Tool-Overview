JDart performs dynamic symbolic execution of Java programs: it executes programs with concrete inputs while recording symbolic constraints on executed program paths. A constraint solver is then used for generating new concrete values from recorded constraints that drive execution along previously unexplored paths. JDart is built on top of the [[JPF]] software model checker and uses the [[JConstraints]] library for the integration of constraint solvers.
