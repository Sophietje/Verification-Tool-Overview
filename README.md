# ProVerB: an overview of tools for program verification

ProVerB is a project aimed at explaining program verification tools to help people find their way around the available tools, clearly and briefly summarising the main purpose of each tool, its current status, relations to other tools, etc.

## Structure of the repo
Below you can find a description of what the different directories contain:
- **Conferences**: Links to all the papers that we have categorised.
- **Formats**: Each page describes a format/language that is used by verification tools.
- **Techniques**: Each page describes a technique/algorithm, not a specific tool.
- **Tools**: Each page describes a tool. We try to include a short description of what it does, if possible a link to the code/tool/repository, and information about tools used as back-ends.
- **Tools/Libraries**: Subdirectory of "Tools". All tools that are libraries/APIs are moved to this subdirectory.
- **Tools/Metatools**: Subdirectory of "Tools". All tools that are metatools are moved to this subdirectory.
