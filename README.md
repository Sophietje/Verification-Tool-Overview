This repository contains information about different tools in the hopes of creating an **overview of verification tools**.

Below you can find a description of what the different directories contain:
- **Conferences**: Links to all the papers that we have categorised.
- **Techniques**: Each page describes a technique/algorithm, not a specific tool.
- **Tools**: Each page describes a tool. We try to include a short description of what it does, if possible a link to the code/tool/repository, and information about tools used as back-ends.
- **Tools/Libraries**: Subdirectory of "Tools". All tools that are libraries/APIs are moved to this subdirectory.
- **Tools/Metatools**: Subdirectory of "Tools". All tools that are metatools are moved to this subdirectory.
