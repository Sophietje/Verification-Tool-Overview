# Program slicing
A **program slice** is a reduced executable program. It takes a program P and removes statements such that the new program P' replicates part of the behaviour of program P. 

**Program slicing** is the computation of a set of program statements (i.e. a program slice) that can possibly affect the values at some points of interest.
