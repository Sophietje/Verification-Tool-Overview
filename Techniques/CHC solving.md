*CHC: Constrained Horn Clauses*

Constrained Horn Clauses (CHC) is a fragment of [First-order logic](First-order%20logic.md). 
Given a CHC formula, determine whether there exists an interpretation  that satisfies the formula.

*Input*: CHC constraints with unknown predicate symbols
*Output*: Interpretation for all predicate symbols such that the constraints are all satisfied
